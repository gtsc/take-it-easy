# Mastering Take It Easy

### On the Game of Take It Easy
This repository aims to determine the ideal strategy for the game "Take It Easy".
Take It Easy is a classic for board games ðŸŽ². Maybe you have played it already.

While it is played with multiple people, the decisions of other players does not influence the outcome of your game, which makes the game an ideal candidate for employing learning strategies to figure out an ideal stratetgy.

In this game, you are placing hexagonal tiles on a board that consists of 19 total spots.

Each turn, 1 of the 27 possible tiles is determined by chance. The player then has to decide where to put the tile on their board. Each tile consists of a vertical and two diagonal (from upper left to lower right and from upper right to lower left) lines.

When 19 tiles are placed, your score is determined by counting the number of continuous lines along the board. For a general strategy that means while it is important to alwways place similar lines in the same column or diagonal, it is not possible to find a perfect solution, even if you could choose the tiles.

The game developer states that the maximum number of points to reach is 307. New players usually score between 100 and 200. While there is a lot of material on the internet how a 307 point configuration could look like (there are multiple ones), the aim of this project is to determine an ideal strategy for maximizing points independent of the tiles that are drawn.

### Roadmap
Besides figuring out an ideal strategy for Take It Easy the aim of this project is to play around with some tools for software development, build up an understanding for DevOps processes using GitHub and employing test-driven development. Hence, progress on the actual goal might be slower from times.

- [x] setting up repository ðŸŽ‰
- [ ] configure build system, unit test suite, pipelines, etc.
- [ ] implementation of basic game engine
- [ ] computer is able to play game at random
- [ ] research & development of self-learning algorithms for optimizing self-play
